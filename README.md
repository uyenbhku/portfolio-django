# My portfolio using Django
My portfolio deployed on Railway using Django Framework and PostgreSQL database. Self-design UI/UX using Figma and Bootstrap 5.

Note: You might feel this similar to my older GitHub [uyenbhku.github.io](https://github.com/uyenbhku/uyenbhku.github.io). It is simply because I made this one based on that repo.
